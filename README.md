Inspiration.
We were inspired by the idea of having a travel buddy for someone going to a new location, hence came up with travAlly. We felt as it it was difficult for people to travel to places, especially if they do not have experience there.

What it does
travAlly helps match travelers who need assistance and more step-by-step help to a platform where they can connect with people who know the location very well. Almost as a virtual guide who will answer any text message or phone call during a specific time that they are rented for.

How we built it
Our tech stack consisted of HTML, CSS, Javascript and React . We used react to create a responsive Navbar that'd help the user navigate to the relevant webpages. We used CSS for styling the wireframes of the pages built in CSS along with CSS properties to achieve functionalities like a smooth scrolling experience. The project currently works for demonstration purposes only due to the given time frame, but we strongly believe in the idea and hope to expand it a lot over the coming days, possibly utilizing a full MERN stack for added features and updates. We also used Github for hosting the site while all the code was written in Javascript and debugged in Visual Studio Code.

Challenges we ran into
One of our very first challenges was that we had a lot of conflict in ideas at first as this was very new to us and all of us had a lot of fresh ideas that felt promising. Once we figured out the idea we were going with, it was a bit challenging to distribute the work within ourselves as we all had interesting skillsets. It was also a bit challenging to finish the project in the given timeline (even though we were very sure and confident of our idea) as this was all of ours first hackathon. Lastly, all of us went out of our comfort zones and challenged ourselves just to make sure we complete our product in the given timeline.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We had multiple accomplishments that we are proud of. Firstly, we are proud of being able to create a project that we are all interested in what we are creating. Secondly, we are proud that we created a foundation in FIGMA, and were able to concretely reach the goal through JavaScript, React, CSS, and HTML. We are glad that we used foundational knowledge that each person should have in JS, ultimately being able to create our landing page and multiple pages attached to our task bar.

What we learned
Since we are a group of first-time hackathon attendees, I feel like we learned a lot about team work, communication, and how to tackle our project as a team. We learned how to brainstorm more efficiently by minimizing distractions and listening more. In addition, we had to learn each other's strengths and weaknesses. Lastly, we had to learn new functions in JavaScript and React. We learned that there are many ways to complete a project. While we were figuring out how to convert our idea into a real product, all of us learned new technologies and use of different existing softwares to make our product's development process easier and efficient.

What's next for travAlly
The next step for travAlly is to gather more data to study trends about where people travel and what are the most common services that are required and could be made easier with the help of our potential thousands of allies. Also, we would be looking into our software architecture and how we can make it more feasible and user friendly for different operating systems and devices.
